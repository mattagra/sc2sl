Hello <%= @old_login %>
<br /><br />
Your username has been changed to <%= @user.login %> , due to the fact that your username was the same as one of the players entering the competition.
<br /><br />
As we apologize for the troubles please observe the fact that you can still use all of the website features. Just remember that from now on your login is no longer <%= @old_login %> but <%= @user.login %>.
<br /><br />
We hope that despite that inconvenience, you will still enjoy the SC2L.
<br /><br />
Best regards,<br />
The SC2SL Staff.
